## **6.15 CodeSpace Pets Instagram Profile Project**

### Overview
In this project, I was building a simplified version of Instagram page focusing on css layout, styling and html. The project is about the CodeSpace Pets Instagram page.

### Reflections

#### Areas of Mastery

- **CSS Layout Techniques**: I can say that css flexbox is the part that I find quite easy to understand. And the grid I am 70% in terms of of understanding it. 
- **Responsive Design**: It was challenging to find the right fonts and size so that the page looks good on different phone or laptops. It was like a trial and error.
- **Styling Elements**: I found it difficult at some points. 

#### Challenges Faced: 
 
- **Responsive Design for Smaller Screens**: I had to google, go through W3schools sites to get help and get the idea to make sure the project comes out perfectly and the codes functions well.
- **Hover and Focus Effects**: The challenges I faced was to add the hover effects on images(container), so I had to go back on the freeCodeCamp to get the idea on how to implement them.

#### Areas for Improvement

- **Advanced CSS Properties**: I think I have to look into the basics or rather I say the foundation css properties before dwelling into the advanced properties.
- **Code Optimization**: I believe there are some codings that can be added or implemented on this project to turn out so perfectly and consistent.
- **Creative Design Choices**: It was interesting working on the Instagram Profile project, I enjoyed it because recently I have been practising some real-life projects on freeCodeCamp.

#### Overall Learning Experience
This project was quite interesting because it challenged me fair enough and gauged my understanding on css layout and html, and practically how deal I deal with this kind of real-life projects.
